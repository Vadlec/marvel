 Marvel Hero API

 This project creates communication links between our phones and Marvel. 
 Gathers information for requested character 
 then displays the returned information on the screen.

 Every component is a function component which makes it easy to read and test, with less code.

 In the app, there are 3pages, which starts with Home. There is a welcome text and title.
 After that it makes you navigate to HeroSearch page. Which takes your character input 
 and sends to Comics Page than to a marvel gateway as a get request. It might take some time due to
 the gateway connection. Then we have to reflesh the page in this version of app, unfortunately.

 When the requested comics array returned, it displays them as a Card Components.

 To make another hero search, you can go Herosearch page with navigation.
